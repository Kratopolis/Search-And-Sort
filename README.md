# Search-And-Sort
I implemented a few search and sort algorithms such as Linear and Binary Search as well as Selection, Insertion, and Quick Sort with sample tests

**  Run 'main.java' to run this project **

Both linear and binary searches are implemented non-recursively, however a recursive binary search exists
Quick sort is implemented recursively as is standard, but selection and insertion sort are both non-recursive, simpler methods
